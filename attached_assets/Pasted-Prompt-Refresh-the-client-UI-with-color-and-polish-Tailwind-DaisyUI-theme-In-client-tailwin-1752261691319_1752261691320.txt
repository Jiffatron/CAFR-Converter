Prompt — “Refresh the client UI with color and polish”

Tailwind / DaisyUI theme
• In client/tailwind.config.js add a custom DaisyUI theme named “muniPro” with primary #1D4ED8, secondary #0E7AEF, accent #E0EFFF, neutral #2E2E3A, and base-100 #F6F9FF.
• Set daisyui.themes to [ "muniPro" ].

Global styles
• In client/src/index.css keep the Tailwind directives but add:
body { @apply bg-gradient-to-br from-base-100 via-white to-accent min-h-screen; }

Navigation bar
• In App.tsx replace the plain navbar with a full-width top bar:
– Logo on the left (FiTrendingUp icon + “CAFR Converter”).
– Right side: “Docs” and “Contact” links styled as link-ghost buttons.
– Use className="navbar bg-primary text-primary-content shadow-lg".

Upload card
• Wrap the existing drop zone inside a DaisyUI card:
– Card header title “Upload CAFR Document”.
– Card body contains FileDrop.
– Use a light accent border (border-accent) and subtle shadow (shadow-md).
• Make the icon & text slate-600; on hover change border to border-secondary.

Status timeline
• If ProcessingSteps exists, color each step:
– Completed steps bg-primary text-primary-content.
– Current step bg-secondary text-secondary-content.
– Pending steps bg-neutral text-neutral-content.

Result card
• Give ResultCard a success accent:
– Card header background bg-primary and text white.
– Stats blocks use stat-accent for titles and text-primary for values.
– “Download CSV” button btn btn-secondary, “Preview Data” btn btn-outline.

Footer
• Add a small footer at page bottom:
className="text-xs text-center mt-12 opacity-70" showing
“Powered by GPT-4o • Tesseract.js OCR • Secure Processing”.

Dark-mode friendliness
• Ensure the gradient background and card colors still read well if DaisyUI’s dark mode is activated (should inherit).

After these changes, rebuild the client (npm --prefix client run dev). The landing page should now have a professional blue theme with a gradient background, elevated upload card, color-coded progress timeline, and branded header/footer.
